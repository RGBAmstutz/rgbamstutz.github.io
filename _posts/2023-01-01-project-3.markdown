description: As part of my extracurricular studies, I decided to explore machine learning further. To enhance my skills, I enrolled in a machine learning course on Udemy, focusing on TensorFlow. One of the notable projects I worked on was developing a natural disaster classifier for analyzing tweets.<br><br>In the image above, you'll notice a column labeled 'Pred,' which represents the model's decision. A value of 0 indicates no disaster, while a value of 1 indicates a natural disaster. After training the model on approximately 7000 data samples, it achieved an impressive accuracy of 80%.  <br><br><a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Uc5Y5onuSEBL1rj2ZXYNYGKl-3WFmMrR?usp=sharing">Source Code</a>
