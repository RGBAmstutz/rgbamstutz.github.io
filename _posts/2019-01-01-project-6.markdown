description: As one of the initial projects in the Udemy course on 2D game development, I created a game that encompasses six unique levels. The game incorporates simple sound and particle effects, along with modified physics. The objective is similar to that of a block breaker game, where hitting all the blocks in a level allows progression to the next stage.
