description: During my studies, I undertook a Game Development course where I was assigned the task of creating a 2D-3D game project with a Halloween theme. After careful consideration, I decided to develop a zombie survival 2D platformer with 3D background elements as my project. <br><br>The game features three distinct enemy types&#58; zombies, witches, and bosses. These enemies are dynamically generated at various spawn points throughout the game. With three distinct levels, the game introduces thrilling conditions for player survival, including the risk of failure due to missing too many shots.
