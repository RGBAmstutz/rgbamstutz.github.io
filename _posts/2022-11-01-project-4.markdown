description: During my studies at Concordia University, I took a course in Game Development and was tasked with creating a 2D-3D game project with a Halloween theme. I decided that creating a zombie survival 2D platformer with 3D background elements would be my best bet. The game features three different enemy types being zombie, witch and boss that all have dynamic spawn points. There are 3 distinct levels with game death conditions like missing too many shots.
